TO WRITE YOUR OWN CLUES, FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS:

  * There are two text files with sample data included in this folder, choose the one applicable to your platform.
  
  * Clues must be separated in these files by one or more blank lines
  
  * To create your own clues, replace the sample data with your own text, taking note of the following:
      
      -Clues are written starting from the top left clue box, then by column.
         ~Example: On a 5x5 board, the first 5 clues will be the clues for the leftmost category, starting at the top. The next 5 will be for the column to the right, starting at the top.
      
      -The line breaks in the text file dictate where the line breaks will be when the clue is printed.
         ~So, a long clue written on a single line will not display properly.
         ~There is a long example clue in the file that serves as a guide for how to format multi-line clues
