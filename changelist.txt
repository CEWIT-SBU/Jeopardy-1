This file is designed as a supplement to the information available via git.
The primary purpose is to explain reasoning for changes and make special
note of particularly volatile changes (deletes, renames, etc).
Minor changes visible by looking at commit history need not be mentioned.


2013/09/09
==================================
* Began complete rebuild. All code will be rewritten. The original code was hugely lacking in abstraction and separation of concerns.
 
* All code will follow PEP 8 (style guide), with very slight personal-preference differences.

* Clues now contained in only one file, 'clues.txt.' 
  User is now responsible for formatting EOL characters properly based on their platform.

* 'game' sub-package created to contain core game logic and data to enhance 
  separation of concerns, which was sorely lacking previously.
	New Modules in this package include:
		* GameData
			-Clues and categories now stored here.
		* GameState
		* JeopPlayer
		* config
		* Unit test suite for all of the above.

* 'ui' sub-package created to contain all view-related modules.
	New module in this package:
		*config

	Completed modules in this package include:
		*Intro
		*CategoryScroll

* There are now separate config.py files for the /src root, the game package, and the ui package.
  This was done both to relieve the bloated look of the original Config.py, and for SoC.

* Directory containing clues.txt renamed 'text' (previously '/res/misc')

* Categories now contained in categories.txt, in the same directory as clues.txt, to avoid confusion.

* Similar to above, subtitle now contained in 'subtitle.txt' in 'text' directory.


2013/09/10
==================================
* Intro sequence (intro.py and categoryscroll.py) in completed working order.


2013/09/11
==================================
* All formatting now much more consistent with PEP8. All names follow its recommendations.

* resmaps.py created in ui package to place all maps to external file paths in one place, rather than being part of config.py.

* Modules added to ui:
	-podiapanel
	-gameboard
	-controller
	-util

* State at end of day: 
	-Intro sequence completed (improved from yesterday)
	-Right panel (podia) completed
	-Game board: grid drawn, category names drawn. Missing amounts, animation, etc.

2013/09/12
=================================
* Created subpackage 'maingame' in ui package.
  Holds podiapanel.py, gameboard.py, and their base class in jeopgamesfc.py
  Did this to declutter the ui package, as well as hide the JeopGameSfc class
  while avoiding overly-long module files.

* Added hasAnswered field to JeopPlayer.
