### Immediate ###

### High priority ###
* Major priority currently is complete rebuild (see changelist).
* Functions from my custom library (import adam.*) need to be made available on Github

### Low priority ###
* Add ability to use audio as clue media, like can be done with images/video.
* Logging
* Allow arbitrary-length categories (within reason).
	UPDATE 9/12
	This is partially completed. Arbitrary-length categories are
	possible, but the font size must be manually set. Hope to
	automatically calculate font size soon.

### Down the Road ###
* Add ability to have recorded clue readings for certain clues or every clue.
* Customizable timeout on clues
* 'Undo' key command to negate last points given, in case of mistake or disagreement.
* Accelerate/decelerate category scroll to make it smoother.
* Final JeoparPy

### Blue Sky ###
* 4:3 mode
