GENERAL INFO

WHAT JEOPARPY IS
================

JeoparPy allows users to customize and host a game 
that includes all the sights, sounds, and excitement
of a TV quiz show! (...that is legally distinguishable 
from any such show).

It is ideal for use in a classroom setting, or as a party/shower game.

WHAT JEOPARPY IS NOT
====================

JeoparPy does NOT include any pre-made sets of categories and clues,
except for placeholders to aid in formatting your own.
It is instead only designed to be used to host custom games that the 
user creates.


GAME DESCRIPTION
================

Three individuals or teams compete for the highest score,
attained by correctly answering questions.
Generally, the questions posed to the players are phrased
as "answers," to which the player must provide the correct
"question," using terminology such as "What is \_\_\_?" or "Who is \_\_\_?".

Users can customize category names, clues, player names, and dollar amounts.
An image can be used to accompany a clue.

By mapping controllers to the buzz-in keys, players can buzz themselves in.
For example, the author used Bluetooth to sync Wiimotes 
to the PC. Doing this is up to the user, as instructions to 
do so are beyond the scope of this document.

One user must "host" a game by choosing clues and telling the game whether
players answered correctly or incorrectly.

.. _`Quick Start`:

***********
QUICK START
***********

0. Read the "Setup" and "Controls" sections of this document.

1. Clone the JeoparPy repository 
   (``git clone git://github.com/adambeagle/jeoparpy.git`` at the command 
   line) or click "Download ZIP" at 
   `JeoparPy's Github page <http://github.com/adambeagle/jeoparpy>`_ and 
   unzip the downloaded .zip file.

2. On Windows, double-click ``Start_JeoparPy.bat`` to run the game. 
   On Linux, run ``start.py`` in the ``src`` folder. Ideally, run it 
   optimized using ``python -OO start.py``. Assuming no changes have
   been made to the files in ``res/`` the game will run with sample
   questions showcasing the available clue types.


.. _Optional Arguments:

******************
OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
******************

There are several optional arguments that can be passed to ``start.py``:

* ``-f`` or ``--fullscreen`` will force the game to run in fullscreen mode.
  This overrides the ``FULLSCREEN`` setting in ``src/jeoparpy/config.py``.
    
* ``-w`` or ``-windowed`` will force the game to run in windowed mode.
  This overrides both the ``FULLSCREEN`` setting in 
  ``src/jeoparpy/config.py`` and the ``-f`` or ``-fullscreen`` arguments
  if either is also passed.
    
* ``-s`` or ``--skip-intro`` will skip the intro sequences (title sequence,
  rules screen, and category scroll) and open the game at the main game
  board. This may be useful when testing customized games.

* ``-d`` or ``--debug`` will turn debug mode on. Typical users should not need 
  this option.
  
Example usage: ``python start.py -f -s`` would run the game in fullscreen,
skipping the intro sequences.

*********************
DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS
*********************

.. _`How to Host a Game`:

**WARNING:** *It is important that a game host read these instructions. 
The game is designed to have a seamless presentation to the players, 
thus instructions for its use do not appear onscreen.*

HOW TO HOST A GAME
==================
To start the game, run ``start.py`` in the ``/src`` folder. On Windows, 
run ``Start_JeoparPy.bat``, located in the same folder as this document.

Upon starting, an introduction will be played. 
When the subtitle appears, press any key to display the rules screen.

To exit the rules screen, press any key.

The categories will now scroll by, requiring no input.

The main game screen will then be displayed, and an animation will play 
filling in the dollar amounts.

At any point during the primary game, Shift+Q can be pressed to 
immediately exit the game. Pressing only 'Q' will trigger the 
end-of-game animations and credits.

You now have control of the mouse. Click a clue box to display it.

If an audio reading of the clicked clue is available, it is played 
immediately, and players can not buzz in until it has finished playing.

When a clue box is open, a player is buzzed in by pressing their corresponding
number on the keyboard. Example: To buzz-in player 2, press '2' on your 
keyboard. It is recommended to map a controller of some kind to these keys.

When a player is buzzed in, one of three things can happen:

* Press spacebar if the player answers correctly. The clue will be closed and
  the game board will return.
* Press 'Backspace' if the player answers incorrectly. Another player can now 
  buzz in. The player that answered incorrectly can not buzz in again on the 
  same question.
* A player fails to answer within the time limit (note the timer at the top
  of a podium after a player buzzes in). This has the same end result as
  pressing 'backspace' above.

If no one answers correctly and time runs out, press 'End' to close a clue 
and return to the game board.

Any clue previously opened can be reopened. 
So, if a clue is clicked by mistake, press 'End.' Its dollar amount will be 
cleared off the board, but it can be reopened and a player can win its amount 
as normal. This method can be used to correct mistakes in scoring, though 
money can not be subtracted from a player's total at this point.

When you wish to end the game (usually when all clues have been completed), 
press 'Q.' This will trigger a 'Congratulations' message to the winner(s), 
and then display the game credits. Alternatively, Shift+Q will quit the game 
immediately.

No input is necessary once the end-of-game animations are triggered, but if 
you wish to quit the game during the credits, you can press 'Q.' The game will
close automatically after the credits.
