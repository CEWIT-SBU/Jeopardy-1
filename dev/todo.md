# Todo #

### Immediate ###

### High priority ###
* Fix fixed font-size issue.
    Font sizes are currently scaled for the resolution, but not scaled for length of text.
    Badly effects player names, category names, clues.
	Could, but not likely to, effect subtitle amounts, and rules.

### Low priority ###
* Add ability to use audio as clue media, like can be done with images.
* Add ability to use recorded clue readings, and not allow buzz-in until they finish.
* Logging
* Write a generic fade_in_surface function (similar tasks done in intro and outro)

### Down the Road ###
* Make intro animation more interesting.
* Make outro animation (currently do_congrats) more interesting.
* Add ability to have recorded clue readings for certain clues or every clue.
* Customizable timeout on clues
* 'Undo' key command to negate last points given, in case of mistake or disagreement.
* Accelerate/decelerate category scroll to make it smoother.
* Daily doubles
* Final JeoparPy

### Blue Sky ###
* 4:3 mode
