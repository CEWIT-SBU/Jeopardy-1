# Todo #

### Immediate ###
* Makes rules rendered text rather than an image. ('Press A' is a big problem)

### High priority ###
* Fix fixed font-size issue.
    Badly effects player names, category names, clues.
	Could, but not likely to, effect subtitle and amounts.

### Low priority ###
* Add ability to use audio as clue media, like can be done with images.
* Add ability to use recorded clue readings, and not allow buzz-in until they finish.
* Logging
* Write a generic fade_in_surface function (similar tasks done in intro and outro)

### Down the Road ###
* Make intro animation more interesting.
* Make outro animation (currently do_congrats) more interesting.
* Add ability to have recorded clue readings for certain clues or every clue.
* Customizable timeout on clues
* 'Undo' key command to negate last points given, in case of mistake or disagreement.
* Accelerate/decelerate category scroll to make it smoother.
* Daily doubles
* Final JeoparPy

### Blue Sky ###
* 4:3 mode
