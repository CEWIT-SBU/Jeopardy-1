# Todo #

### Immediate ###

### High priority ###

### Low priority ###
* Logging
* Write a generic fade_in_surface function (similar tasks done in intro and outro)
* GameState arg should be kwargs-like-dict to clarify code that gets/sets the state args.
* Command line arguments to disable intro/scroll (for debugging purposes); possibly to set resolution/fullscreen.

### Down the Road ###
* Customizable timeout on clues
* Accelerate/decelerate category scroll to make it smoother.
* Daily doubles
* Final JeoparPy

### Blue Sky ###
* User-friendly customization GUI; could allow save/load of custom game data.
* 'Undo' key command to negate last points given, in case of mistake or disagreement.
* Make intro animation more interesting.
* Make outro animation (currently do_congrats) more interesting.
* 4:3 mode
